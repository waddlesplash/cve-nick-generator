CVE Nickname Generator
============================
Coming up with nicknames for vulnerability can get annoying, so this webpage can do it for you.
It uses [rng.js](https://github.com/skeeto/rng-js) seeded with the CVE ID of the vulnerability
and a per-year database of words that it uses to generate the two-word nickname. (For 2014, the
database was created by extacting words from [NSA codenames](http://cryptome.org/2014/01/nsa-codenames.htm).)

This was concieved in [a single Twitter convo](https://twitter.com/supersat/status/522526935260209153)
